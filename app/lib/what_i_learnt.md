//I learned....


  //your game is disorganized because you had no hidea
  //How to structure a game when you started
  //you do know now yes
  //but at the beggining you didn't understand fps or
  //shadows
  //gradients
  //programmatical animaitons
  //and animations
  //this project, forced me to grow as mucha as I
  //could in the Dart environment, and in programming itself
  //Now with new technologies and my knowledge in flutter and dart
  //i can become unstoppable but i need ai
  //machine learning
  //data processing
  //and other techniques
  //that i learnt or at least dipped into with my webscraper
  //which was a simplified version of an ultimate goal
  //getting into ai and machine learning
  //and levergaging new and upcoming tools like quantum via apis
  //but more than that
  //optimize your systems using quantum
  //right now computers and processors
  //are fast
  //quantum will FAST!^
  //exponentially

// 1. I should make the ui more flexible 
//    Say Have a theme object 
//    With a color 
//    Buttons color 
//    So whenever i want to change certain colors of the app 
//    I can do it in a single place 
//    That is sort of bootstrap 
//    If you were going to sell a bootstrap theme
//    Your client would love to only have to change a single file 
//    Theme 
//    or create their own 
//    And have the changes show everywhere 
//    That would be the easiest thing ever

//    What if in our future projects we had a object 
//    That would carry an navigator/router 
//    A Theme 
//    although come to think about it 
//    flutter has a theme 
//    but 
//    its not mine 
//    that's a dependency 
//    so according to clean architecture i should probably 
//    have my own theme object

//    What ever just think of ways to make navigation and ui flexible 
//    and easy to change
//    and use them in every project 
//    make them as flexible as possible

// 2. I should design the app from start to finish on paper first 
//    and then start coding
//    I should also organize my folders better 
//    and knowing what i want to do 
//    I can start with test driven development
//    the reason TDD was so hard for me was because 
//    I didn't have a clear idea of where I was goin 
//    So I was writing the app to find out 
//    Instead of going in with a plan 

// 3. Manage my stress better 
//   I am good at managing my time but not my stress 
//   9 hours of coding made 3 anxiety hours and 6 working hours 
//   If I have a plan I won't get anxious 
//   I will know what to do
//   And it will save me lots of time 

// 4. Time management and delegation 
//   With ned tools emerging such as chatgtp 
//   That can write easy code 
//   If I have a very detailed plan of what i want to do and write my tests 
//   I can delegate the coding to chatgtp
//   And I can focus on the design 
//   Making sure the app is the best written app ever 
//   It must use clena architecture 
//   And I need to make sure my design uses Clean Architecture 
//   So while I am drawing it up 
//   I need to take CA into consideration 
//   We will first just connect the modules 
//   Then design the modules 
//   Connect the classes 
//   Determine how they interact with each other 
//   And then write the functions each class needs along with the parameters 
//   Then once I have that 
//   Everything should be easy 

//   I create the folders and create the files with all the functions
//   Then I write the tests
//   And then some else could be writing the ui 
//   And someone else writing the code for the files 
//   And then we can all come together and connect the files
//   And it would be easy 
//   But right not it's just me 
//   So I need to write the code that way 
//   Because if my app is succesful 
//   I will eventually need a team 
//   And this approach would allow us all to code simultaneously
